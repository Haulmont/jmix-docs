= Screens and Fragments

A screen is a main unit of the Backoffice UI. It contains visual components, data containers, and non-visual components. A screen can be displayed inside the main application window either in a tab or as a modal dialog.

The main part of the screen is a Java or Groovy class called xref:backoffice-ui:screens/screen-controllers.adoc[controller]. A layout of the screen is usually defined in an XML file called xref:backoffice-ui:screens/descriptors.adoc[descriptor].

In order to show a screen, the framework creates a new instance of the `Window` visual component, connects the window with the screen controller and loads the screen layout components as child components of the window. After that, the screenâ€™s window is added to the main application window.

A fragment is another UI building block that can be used as a part of screens and other fragments. It is very similar to screen internally but has a specific lifecycle and the `Fragment` visual component instead of `Window` at the root of the components tree. Fragments also have controllers and XML descriptors.
