= Themes

Themes are used to manage the visual presentation of the application.

A theme consists of https://sass-lang.com/[SCSS] files and other resources like images.

Jmix provides built-in compiled themes for convenience and demo purpose. In real projects, themes must be extended. A theme extension allows you to modify an existing theme on the project level. You can also create a project with the theme add-on.

If you want to use a theme in multiple projects, you can include it in an application component or create a reusable theme JAR.
