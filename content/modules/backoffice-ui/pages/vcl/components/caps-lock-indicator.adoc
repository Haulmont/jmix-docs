[[basics]]
== Basics

The `CapsLockIndicator` component is designed to be used together with the `PasswordField` and handles the Caps Lock state only when this field is focused. When the field loses its focus, the state is changed to inactive.

Usage example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/capslockindicator/caps-lock-indicator-screen.xml[tags=caps-lock]
----

== Attributes

* The `capsLockOnMessage` and `capsLockOffMessage` attributes allow you to define the messages that will be shown by the component depending on the current Caps Lock state.
* Changing visibility of the `CapsLockIndicator` component dynamically using the `visible` attribute when the screen is already opened may not work as expected.
