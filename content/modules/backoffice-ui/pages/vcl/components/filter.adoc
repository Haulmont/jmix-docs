The `Filter` component is a versatile tool for filtering the data it is bound to.

The component enables <<quick-filtering,quick data filtering>> by arbitrary conditions, as well as creating <<configuration,configurations>> for repeated use.

Component’s XML-name: `filter`.

== Basics

`Filter` should be connected to a data loader defined for a `CollectionContainer` or `KeyValueCollectionContainer`. The loader should contain a link:https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/JPQL[JPQL^] query. `Filter` operates by modifying the query under the criteria provided by the user. Thus, filtering is done at the database level when the SQL query is executed, and only selected data is loaded to the Backoffice UI.

By default, Jmix Studio generates the `Filter` component when creating an entity master-detail or entity browser screens.

An example of `filter` declaration in the XML screen descriptor is shown below:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=data-start;customersDc;data-end;layout-start;filter;customersTable;layout-end]
----

In the example above, the data container holds the collection of `Customer` entity instances. The data loader loads the collection using a JPQL query. The loader’s query is modified by the filter component connected to the loader using the `dataLoader` attribute. Data is displayed using the `Table` component, which is connected to the data container.

A typical filter is shown below:

image::vcl/components/filter-anatomy.png[align="center"]

[[add-condition-link]]
* The *Add search condition* link (1).

[[refresh-drop-down-menu]]
* The drop-down menu with the saved filters and configurations (2).

[[refresh-button]]
* The *Refresh* button with the drop-down menu (3).

[[operation-selector]]
* The operation selector (4).

[[condition-fields]]
* The condition value field (5).

[[filter-settings-button]]
* The filter settings popup button (6).

[[quick-filtering]]
By default, the component is in quick filter mode. This means that a user can add a set of conditions for a one-off data search. After the screen is closed, the conditions will disappear.

[[quick-filter-example]]
== Quick Filter Example

Let’s consider that we have the `Customer` entity and want to:

* Create a quick filter with multiple conditions in the *Customer browser* screen.
* Save this filter for the future.

=== Creating a Quick Filter

* Click the *Add search condition* link(<<add-condition-link,1>>).
* Select the *Age* property in the *Properties* list.
* Select the *Hobby* property.
+
Selected conditions are displayed at the top of the filter panel.
* Modify the condition value fields and operations:

image::vcl/components/filter-sample.png[align="center"]

=== Saving the Filter

* Click the filter settings icon(<<filter-settings-button,6>>), select *Save with values*.
* Provide a new filter configuration name in the *Save filter configuration* dialog:
+
image::vcl/components/filter-sample-save.png[align="center"]

After that, the filter will be saved and appear in the *Refresh* button's drop-down menu(<<refresh-button,3>>).

image::vcl/components/filter-sample-refresh.png[align="center"]

The *Reset filter* menu lets you reset all currently applied search conditions.

[[add-condition]]
== Add Condition

To create a quick filter, click the *Add search condition* link (<<add-condition-link,1>>). The *Add condition* screen will be displayed:

image::vcl/components/filter-add-condition.png[align="center"]

Possible condition types are described below:

* *Properties* - attributes of this entity and related entities. Only persistent attributes are displayed. They should comply with the rules specified in the <<filter-element-properties,properties>> element.

[[predefined-conditions]]
* *Predefined conditions* are conditions specified by the developer in the <<filter-element-conditions,conditions>> element in the XML descriptor. Predefined conditions are not initially added to any configurations, but the user can select them in the *Add Condition* screen and add it to the <<run-time-configuration,run-time configuration>>.

* *Configurations* can be created at design-time or run-time (via the <<configuration,Configuration editor>>).

Selected conditions are displayed at the top of the filter panel. The image:vcl/components/filter-remove-condition.png[] icon will appear next to each condition field, allowing them to be removed from the set.

[[registered-filters-popup-button]]
The number of <<filter-component-registration,registered>> filter components determines the set of possible drop-down actions for the *Create* button. Three filter components named <<property-filter,PropertyFilter>>, <<jpql-filter,JpqlFilter>>, and <<group-filter,GroupFilter>> are available by default:

* `PropertyFilter` corresponds to <<property-conditions,property conditions>>.
* `JpqlFilter` corresponds to <<jpql-conditions,JPQL conditions>>.
* `GroupFilter` corresponds to <<group-conditions,group conditions>>.

image::vcl/components/filter-create-filter-button.png[align="center"]

So the user has the opportunity to create filter conditions in run-time.

[[property-conditions]]
=== Property Conditions

The *Property conditions editor* allows users to configure the attributes of the xref:vcl/components/property-filter.adoc[PropertyFilter] component. `PropertyFilter` is related to the entity property.

image::vcl/components/filter-property-conditions.png[align="center"]

Select the entity attribute in the *Property* field.

The *Operation* field enables selecting the condition xref:vcl/components/property-filter.adoc#operation[operator]. The list of available operations depends on the attribute type.

Use the *Parameter Name* attribute to set the name of the associated query parameter name. You can use this name to introduce dependencies between filter components in configuration. If not defined, then the parameter name is randomly generated.

You can set the custom caption of the property filter condition in the *Caption* field.

Use the *Operation editable* checkbox to set whether an operation selector is visible. If you select this checkbox, the operation field enables selecting the condition operator in run-time.

Use the *Operation caption visible* checkbox to define the visibility of the operation caption.

You can set the default value for the filter condition in the *Default Value* field.

[[jpql-conditions]]
=== Jpql Conditions

The *Jpql conditions editor* allows users to create conditions based on JPQL expressions.

image::vcl/components/filter-jpql-conditions.png[align="center"]

In the *Parameter type* field, you should select the Java class of the condition parameter. The `No parameter` value lets you create a condition without parameters. For example:

image::vcl/components/filter-jpql-conditions-no-parameters.png[align="center"]

The *Caption* field is required. You should set the condition name displayed in the filter.

Use the *Parameter Name* attribute to set the name of the associated query parameter. You can use this name to introduce dependencies between filter components in configuration. If not defined, then the parameter name is randomly generated.

Use the *Has IN expression* checkbox to define whether JPQL expression should contain `IN` expression. In this case, the application will use the xref:vcl/components/values-picker.adoc[ValuesPicker] component for creating the list of condition values.

You can set the default value for the filter condition in the *Default Value* field.

[[jpql-conditions-join]]
In the *Join* field, you can specify JPQL expression, which will be added to the `from` data loader query section. This can be required to create a complex condition based on an attribute of a related collection. The expression should be started with `join` or `left join` statements. The `{E}` placeholder should be used in the expression instead of the alias of the entity being selected.

image::vcl/components/filter-jpql-conditions-join.png[align="center"]

[[jpql-conditions-where]]
The value in the *Where* field specifies the JPQL expression, which will be added to the `where` data loader query section. The `{E}` placeholder should be used in the expression instead of the alias of the entity being selected. The condition can only have one parameter denoted by `?` if used.

[[group-conditions]]
=== Group Conditions

The *Group conditions editor* allows users to combine several conditions into a logical group.

image::vcl/components/filter-group-conditions.png[align="center"]

The *Operation* drop-down allows users to select a logical group operator.

The *Caption* field is required. You should set the condition name displayed in the filter.

Use the *Operation caption visible* checkbox to define the visibility of the operation caption.

To add a condition, click the *Add* button. The <<add-condition,Add condition>> screen will be displayed.

The filter conditions are contained in the tree. Users can determine the order of filter conditions in a filter using the image:vcl/components/filter-group-conditions-move-down.png[align="center"]/image:vcl/components/filter-group-conditions-move-up.png[align="center"] buttons and remove and edit conditions using the *Remove* and *Edit* buttons.

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

A configuration is a set of filter components.

`LogicalFilterComponent` is the root element of the configuration.

The configuration does not store a reference to all components but stores a reference only to the root element, from which the rest filter components can be obtained.

Configurations can be created at design-time or run-time (via the <<run-time-configuration,Configuration editor>> screen).

[[design-time-configuration]]
=== Design-time Configuration

Design-time configuration cannot be changed and saved in run-time. Still, the user can use the `Copy` action that copies all conditions from the design-time configuration to the run-time configuration.

All design-time configurations are displayed in the drop-down menu(<<refresh-drop-down-menu,2>>) with the saved filters and configurations:

image::vcl/components/filter-design-time-configuration.png[align="center"]

An example of `filter` with design-time configurations in the XML screen descriptor is shown below:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=filter-design-time-configuration]
----

`id` is a required attribute and must be unique within this filter. If the `name` attribute is not specified, then `id` is used as a key in the xref:localization:message-bundles.adoc[message bundle].

[[design-time-configuration-default]]
Use the `default` XML attribute to set the design-time configuration as default for filter. So it appears right after opening the screen.

[[run-time-configuration]]
=== Run-time Configuration

To create, edit or remove configurations in run-time, a user should have <<ui-filter-modifyConfiguration,ui.filter.modifyConfiguration>> security permission.

To open the *Configuration editor* screen, use the *Edit* action in the <<filter-actions,Settings>> popup button.

image::vcl/components/filter-run-time-configuration.png[align="center"]

The *Configuration name* field is required. You should set the configuration name displayed in the drop-down menu(<<refresh-drop-down-menu,2>>) with the saved filters and configurations.

[[available-for-all-users]]
You can set filter available to all users using the *Available for all users* checkbox. This checkbox is only available to users having the specific <<ui-filter-modifyGlobalConfiguration,ui.filter.modifyGlobalConfiguration>> permission.

[[default-for-all-users]]
Use the *Default for all users* checkbox to set whether the created configuration will be automatically selected when users open the screen. This checkbox is enabled if the *Available for all users* checkbox is selected.

The other *Configuration editor* fields are described in <<group-conditions,Group Conditions>>.

[[filter-actions]]
== Filter Actions

The filter settings popup button(<<filter-settings-button,6>>) image:vcl/components/filter-settings-popup.png[align="center"] provides the list of actions for the filter management. The following actions are displayed in the settings popup button by default:

* *Save* - see <<filter-save-action,FilterSaveAction>>.
* *Save with values* - see <<filter-save-with-values-action,FilterSaveWithValuesAction>>.
* *Save as* - see <<filter-save-as-action,FilterSaveAsAction>>.
* *Edit* - see <<filter-edit-action,FilterEditAction>>.
* *Remove* - see <<filter-remove-action,FilterRemoveAction>>.
* *Make default* - see <<filter-make-default-action,FilterMakeDefaultAction>>.
* *Copy* - see <<filter-copy-action,FilterCopyAction>>.
* *Clear values* - see <<filter-clear-values-action,FilterClearValuesAction>>.

[[filter-default-actions]]
The framework provides the following default actions for the filter component:

[[filter-edit-action]]
* `FilterEditAction` (`type="filter_edit"` in XML) - edits the current <<run-time-configuration,run-time filter configuration>> (opens the *Configuration editor* screen). Disabled for <<design-time-configuration,design-time configurations>>.

[[filter-copy-action]]
* `FilterCopyAction` (`type="filter_copy"` in XML) - copies all conditions from the design-time configuration to the run-time configuration.

[[filter-clear-values-action]]
* `FilterClearValuesAction` (`type="filter_clearValues"` in XML) - clears the filter condition values(<<condition-fields,5>>).

[[filter-save-action]]
* `FilterSaveAction` (`type="filter_save"` in XML) - saves changes to the current filter configuration.

[[filter-save-with-values-action]]
* `FilterSaveWithValuesAction` (`type="filter_saveWithValues"` in XML) - saves changes to the current filter using the values in the condition fields(<<condition-fields,5>>) as the filter default values.

[[filter-save-as-action]]
* `FilterSaveAsAction` (`type="filter_saveAs"` in XML) - saves the filter configuration under a new name.

[[filter-remove-action]]
* `FilterRemoveAction` (`type="filter_remove"` in XML) - removes the current run-time filter configuration. Disabled for design-time configurations.

[[filter-make-default-action]]
* `FilterMakeDefaultAction` (`type="filter_makeDefault"` in XML) - makes the filter configuration default for this screen. The filter will be automatically displayed on the filter panel when the screen is opened. Takes precedence over the <<design-time-configuration-default,default>> attribute of design-time configuration and the <<default-for-all-users,Default for all users>> checkbox of run-time configuration. It is disabled if no `screenSettings` facet is added to the screen.

* `FilterAddConditionAction` (`type="filter_addCondition"` in XML) - adds a condition to the current filter configuration.

[[filter-components]]
== Filter Components

The `Filter` component can only work with components that implement the `FilterComponent` interface. If the component is a container for placing multiple filter components, it needs to implement the `LogicalFilterComponent` interface.

There are three filter components available by default:

* <<property-filter,PropertyFilter>>;
* <<jpql-filter,JpqlFilter>>;
* <<group-filter,GroupFilter>>.

You can register your own filter component, see <<filter-component-registration,Filter Component Registration>>.

[[property-filter]]
=== PropertyFilter

The `PropertyFilter` component can be used inside the `Filter` component and independently.

The example below demonstrates how to create a design-time configuration with a `PropertyFilter`:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=data-start;customersDc;data-end;layout-start;property-filter;layout-end]
----

See the additional information in xref:vcl/components/property-filter.adoc[PropertyFilter].

[[jpql-filter]]
=== JpqlFilter

`JpqlFilter` is a UI component used for filtering entities returned by the `DataLoader`. The component contains JPQL expressions that will be added to the `from` and `where` data loader query sections. The component can automatically render the proper layout for setting a condition value. A `JpqlFilter` layout contains a label with a caption and a field for editing a condition value in the general case. The component can be used only inside the `Filter` component.

The example below demonstrates how to create a design-time configuration with a `JpqlFilter`:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=window-start;data-start;customersDc;data-end;layout-start;filter-jpql-filter-start;filter-jpql-filter-simple;filter-jpql-filter-end;layout-end;window-end]
----
<1> You should add the JPQL conditions namespace.
<2> Define a JPQL condition with optional `join` element and mandatory `where` element.

To configure JPQL conditions, define the `condition` element inside `jpqlFilter` with optional <<jpql-conditions-join,join>> element and mandatory <<jpql-conditions-where,where>> element. In the example below, we create `jpqlFilter` with the `join` and `where` elements:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=filter-jpql-filter-start;filter-jpql-filter-join-where;filter-jpql-filter-end]
----

`jpqlFilter` attributes inside the `filter` component:

[[jpql-filter-caption]]
* You can set the condition name displayed in filter, using the `caption` attribute.
[[jpql-filter-has-in-expression]]
* The `hasInExpression` attribute should be set to `true` if the JPQL expression contains `in (?)` conditions. In this case, the application will use the xref:vcl/components/values-picker.adoc[ValuesPicker] component. So the user will be able to enter several condition parameter values.
+
Below is an example of `jpqlFilter` with the `hasInExpression` attribute:
+
[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=filter-jpql-filter-start;filter-jpql-filter-has-in-expression;filter-jpql-filter-end]
----

[[jpql-filter-parameter-class]]
* `parameterClass` is a required attribute; it defines the Java class of the condition parameter.
[[jpql-filter-parameter-name]]
* `parameterName` - the name of the associated query parameter. You can use this name to introduce dependencies between filter components in configuration. If not defined, then the parameter name is randomly generated.

[[group-filter]]
=== GroupFilter

The `GroupFilter` component is a composite component that has a xref:vcl/containers/group-box-layout.adoc[GroupBoxLayout] with a xref:vcl/containers/responsive-grid-layout.adoc[ResponsiveGridLayout] as its root container. This component is needed to combine several conditions into a logical group, using logical operators (`AND` or `OR`). The component can be used only inside the `Filter` component.

The example below demonstrates how to create a design-time configuration with a `GroupFilter`:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=filter-group-filter]
----

[[group-filter-operation]]
The `operation` attribute is required. Two logical operations are available:

* `AND` is the default operation.
* `OR`.

[[filter-component-registration]]
== Filter Component Registration

To create and register a UI filter component in the framework, you need the following objects:

* A component class - a UI component that will be displayed inside the `Filter` component. A component class should extend the `FilterComponent` class. As an example of a component class, consider the `PropertyFilter` class.
* A model class - a non-persistent class that stores the state of the filter component. A model class is used to save the filter component state in DB and display and change the state of the filter component at run-time. A model class should extend the `FilterCondition` class. As an example of a model class, consider the `PropertyFilterCondition` class.
* A converter class is needed for converting between a component and a model. A converter class should implement the `FilterConverter` interface.
* An edit screen - the model edit screen. If no identifier is specified, then the default identifier (for example, `modelName.edit`, `PropertyFilterCondition.edit`) will be used.

`PropertyFilter` registration example:

[source,indent=0]
----
    @Bean
    public FilterComponentRegistration registerPropertyFilter() {
        return FilterComponentRegistrationBuilder.create(PropertyFilter.class,
                PropertyFilterCondition.class,
                PropertyFilterConverter.class)
                .withEditScreenId("ui_PropertyFilterCondition.edit")
                .build();
    }
----

All registered filter components are displayed in a <<registered-filters-popup-button,PopupButton>> on the `AddConditionScreen` so that the user has the opportunity to create a filter component in run-time. Pressing the button will open the editor screen for the selected filter component.

This method of registering filter components is convenient because users can register the filter components in different modules. Also, users can replace the filter component registered in the Jmix framework with their own implementation by specifying the `@Order` annotation (for example, to expand the set of model attributes saved by the filter).

[[filter-elements]]
== Filter Elements

`filter` defined in the XML descriptor may contain nested elements. They describe conditions available for user selection in the *Add Condition* dialog:

[[filter-element-properties]]
=== properties

The `properties` element allows you to make multiple entity attributes available for selection. This element has the following attributes:
[[filter-element-properties-include]]
* `include` is a required attribute. It contains a regular expression, which should match an entity attribute name.
[[filter-element-properties-exclude]]
* `exclude` - contains a regular expression. If an attribute matches the expression, it will be excluded from previously included (using `include`).
* `excludeProperties` - contains a comma-separated list of property paths that should be excluded from filtering. As opposed to exclude, it supports traversing the entity graphs, for example, `customer.name`.
* `excludeRecursively` - defines if an attribute from `excludeProperties` should be excluded recursively for the whole object graph. If `true`, an attribute and all its nested attributes with the same name will be excluded.

In the example below, we declare a `filter` component with the `properties` nested element:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=filter-with-properties]
----

The following entity attributes are ignored when the `properties` element is used:

* Not accessible due to the xref:security:index.adoc[security] permissions.
* Collections (`@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany`).
* Non-persistent attributes.
* Attributes annotated with `@SystemLevel`.
* Attributes of type `byte[]`.

[[filter-element-conditions]]
=== conditions

The `conditions` element is used to create <<predefined-conditions,predefined conditions>>.

In the example below, we declare a `filter` component with the `conditions` nested element:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=filter-with-conditions]
----

The `conditions` element may contain any number of <<property-filter,propertyFilter>>, <<jpql-filter,jpqlFilter>> or <<group-filter,groupFilter>>.

[[filter-element-configurations]]
=== configurations

The `configurations` element is used to create <<design-time-configuration,design-time configurations>>.

[[filter-element-actions]]
=== actions

Users can override <<filter-default-actions,default>> actions using the `actions` nested element. For example:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/filter-screen.xml[tags=filter-with-actions]
----

You can configure common action parameters using XML attributes of the `action` element, see xref:actions.adoc[Actions] for details.

[[filter-attributes]]
== Filter Attributes

[[filter-attribute-auto-apply]]
=== autoApply

The `autoApply` attribute specifies when the filter is applied. If the attribute value is `false`, filter will be applied only after the *Refresh* button is clicked. If the attribute value is `true`, filter is applied immediately after changing the filter components. The default value is specified in the xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix-ui-component-filter-auto-apply[jmix.ui.component.filterAutoApply] property.

[[filter-attribute-columns-count]]
=== columnsCount
The `columnsCount` sets the number of columns to be displayed on one row. The default value is specified in the xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix-ui-component-filter-columns-count[jmix.ui.component.filterColumnsCount] property.

[[filter-attribute-caption-position]]
=== captionPosition

The `captionPosition` attribute defines the caption position of filter child components: `TOP` or `LEFT`. The default value is `LEFT`.

[[permissions]]
== Permissions

Advanced filter management requires special permissions. Such permissions are set in the *UI: edit filters* predefined resource role:

[[ui-filter-modifyConfiguration]]
* To create/change/delete filter <<configuration,configurations>>, users must have the
`ui.filter.modifyConfiguration` specific permission.

[[ui-filter-modifyGlobalConfiguration]]
* To create/change/delete global (<<available-for-all-users,available for all users>>) filter configurations, users must have the `ui.filter.modifyGlobalConfiguration` specific permission.

[[ui-filter-modifyJpqlCondition]]
* To create/change <<jpql-conditions,jpql conditions>> in run-time, users must have the `ui.filter.modifyJpqlCondition` specific permission.

For specific permissions configuration information, see xref:security:resource-roles.adoc[Security Subsystem].

[[ui-properties]]
== UI Properties

The following application properties affect the filter behavior:

* xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix-ui-component-filter-auto-apply[jmix.ui.component.filterAutoApply];
* xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix-ui-component-filter-columns-count[jmix.ui.component.filterColumnsCount];
* xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix-ui-component-filter-properties-hierarchy-depth[jmix.ui.component.filterPropertiesHierarchyDepth];
* xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix-ui-component-filter-show-configuration-id-field[jmix.ui.component.filterShowConfigurationIdField].

[[handlers]]
== Events and Handlers

include::../events-hanlers-generation-tip.adoc[]

[[context-help-icon-click-handler]]
=== ContextHelpIconClickHandler

See xref:vcl/api.adoc#context-help-icon-click-handler[ContextHelpIconClickHandler].

[[expanded-state-change-event]]
=== ExpandedStateChangeEvent

See xref:vcl/api.adoc#expanded-state-change-event[ExpandedStateChangeEvent].

[[configuration-change-event]]
=== ConfigurationChangeEvent

ConfigurationChangeEvent is sent when <<configuration,configuration>> is changed. Example of subscribing to the event for `filter` defined in the screen XML with the `filter` id:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/FilterScreen.java[tags=configuration-change-event]
----

Programmatic registration of the event handler: use the `addConfigurationChangeListener()` component method.

[[properties-filter-predicate]]
=== propertiesFilterPredicate

To <<filter-element-properties-include,include>> or <<filter-element-properties-exclude,exclude>> properties programmatically, use the `addPropertiesFilterPredicate()` method of the `Filter` component:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/filter/FilterScreen.java[tags=properties-filter-predicate]
----

The `addPropertiesFilterPredicate()` method adds a predicate to the current properties filter predicate. The result predicate is a composed predicate that represents a short-circuiting logical AND of given predicate and current properties filter predicate.
