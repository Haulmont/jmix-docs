[[basics]]
== Basics

The definition of the drawer in the screen descriptor should have the following structure:

1. xref:vcl/containers/css-layout.adoc[CssLayout] that contains both `drawer` and the rest of the screen layout, with `jmix-drawer-layout` style assigned.
2. The `drawer` itself should include the following containers, those represent:
a. `Drawer` header, with `jmix-drawer-header` style assigned.
//todo add link to SideMenu
b. `Drawer` content, for example, `SideMenu`, with `jmix-drawer-content` style assigned.
c. `Drawer` footer, with `jmix-drawer-footer` style assigned.
3. A xref:vcl/components/button.adoc[button] placed within a `drawer` footer and used to toggle `Drawer` collapsed state.

[[toggle]]
== Toggle

The `toggle()` method expands or collapses the `drawer` depending on its current state. For example, if the `drawer` is already collapsed, it will be expanded after calling the `toggle()` method, and vice versa.

[[is-collapsed]]
You can also check the drawer's current state using the `isCollapsed()` method.
