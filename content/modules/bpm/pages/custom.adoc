= Custom Form

Custom process forms can be useful if you need to render a form in a non-standard way. In the modeler, you can provide a form id, a list of form parameters and a list of outcomes for a custom form.

If you use an alternative UI technology (for example, React) then you need to get the form information and render the form using this information. You can obtain form information using the `FormService` interface that has the following methods:

* `StartFormData getStartFormData​(String processDefinitionId)`
* `TaskFormData getTaskFormData​(String taskId)`

To render custom forms in the *Start process* or *My tasks* screens, you need to define the `ProcessFormScreenCreator` for the `custom` form type. To override the default `ProcessFormScreenCreator`, you need to add the `@Order` annotation.

Let's look at the example of `MyCustomProcessFormScreenCreator` that implements `ProcessFormScreenCreator`: 

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/bpm/ex1/service/MyCustomProcessFormScreenCreator.java[tags=custom]
----

<1> The `@Order` annotation indicates that this implementation of `ProcessForScreenCreator` will be used first.
<2> `ScreenCreator` will be applied to custom process forms.
<3> Overrides the method for creating a start process form.
<4> Checks if the screen implements `AcceptsProcessDefinition`. In this case, it is necessary to set `ProcessDefiniton` to the screen.
<5> Overrides the method for creating a task process form.
<6> Checks if the screen implements `AcceptsTask`. In this case, it is necessary to set `Task` to the screen.

An example of the `AcceptsProcessDefinition` interface:

[source,java,indent=0]

include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/bpm/ex1/service/AcceptsProcessDefinition.java[tags=custom]

An example of the `AcceptsTask` interface:

Screen controller of the custom start form:

XML descriptor of the custom task form that has only *Task complete* button:

[source,java,indent=0]

Screen controller of the custom task form:
