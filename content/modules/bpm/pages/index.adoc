= BPM

BPM add-on is used for modeling and running business processes. Processes are described using BPMN 2.0 notation. The add-on uses https://flowable.com/open-source/[Flowable^] as a business process engine and https://bpmn.io/[bpmn-js^] rendering toolkit for process modeling.

This manual mostly describes features added by the add-on, not features provided by underlying frameworks, so you must be familiar with the Flowable engine.

== Installation

To include BPM in your application, follow the steps below.

. Add your Jmix premium repository credentials to the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file (create the file if it doesn't exist). For example:
+
[source,properties]

premiumRepoPass=abcdefghkilm
----

. Add Jmix premium repository to your `build.gradle` file:
+
[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url 'https://nexus.jmix.io/repository/public'
    }
    maven {
        url('https://nexus.jmix.io/repository/premium')
        credentials {
            username("${rootProject['premiumRepoUser']}")
            password("${rootProject['premiumRepoPass']}")
        }
    }
----
