= Entity Inspector

Entity Inspector provides auto-generated UI for your data model entities. It allows you to browse, create, update and remove entity instances without creating any specific UI. Also, if your entity is soft-deleted, Entity Inspector lets you browse, restore or wipe out deleted instances.

Entity Inspector respects data access constraints imposed by xref:security:index.adoc[security], so it can be helpful both for administrators and for users with limited permissions.

In case the entity is soft-deleted, you can select displaying the removed entities and restore or wipe them out.

You can use Entity Inspector to export and import any simple entities including system entities. *Entity Inspector* screen displays actions for exporting the selected entity instances as ZIP or JSON and importing them to the system.

NOTE: Keep in mind that when an entity is exported using the Entity Inspector, reference attributes with the one-to-many or many-to-many relationship type are not included.
