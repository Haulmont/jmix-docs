== Creating Docker Image
In Jmix studio, open the *Gradle* tool window (usually it is located on the right side of the IDE) and select *Tasks -> build -> bootBuildImage* task.

TIP: In the command line, use the following command:

[source]
----
$ gradle bootBuildImage
----

By default, the image will be uploaded to the image repository using the name which is equal to your project's name and tag equals to you project's version.

For example, if you specified the following in your `settings.gradle`:

[source]
----
rootProject.name = 'jmix-sample-planner'
----

and in your `build.gradle`:

[source]
----
group = 'com.company'
version = '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'
----

then your image will be uploaded as

[source]
----
jmix-sample-planner:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
----
