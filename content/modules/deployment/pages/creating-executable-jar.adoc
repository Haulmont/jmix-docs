== Creating Executable Jar

In Jmix studio, open the *Gradle* tool window (usually it is located on the right side of the IDE) and select *Tasks -> build -> bootJar* task.

TIP: In the command line, use the following command:

[source]
project-root$ gradle bootJar

You can find the executable jar file in the `project-root/build/libs` folder.

If you want to customize the packaging process or create a deployable `.war` file, please refer to the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.1/gradle-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#packaging-executable[Spring Boot Documentation^].
