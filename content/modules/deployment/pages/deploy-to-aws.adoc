Before starting the guide, please create an account and ensure that you have an access to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home[AWS Console^]

TIP: We will use PostgreSQL database as an example for this guide.

== Deploying Fat Jar
The simplest way to deploy the application's fat jar to AWS is to use link:https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/[Elastic Beanstalk Service^](EBS).

=== Preparing The Application

Since we have more than database connections now (local for development and AWS), we need to configure additional properties file that will contain connection properties for AWS environment.

To switch between different configurations, we will use link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.x/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-profiles[Runtime Profiles^]. For our case, we will use profile name `aws`.

Let's create `application-aws.properties` file according to naming rules described in link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.x/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config-files-profile-specific[Spring Boot Documentation].

In this file, we will specify database connection properties using AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment variables:

* `RDS_HOSTNAME` - internal EBS-specific database host name
* `RDS_PORT` - database port allocated by EBS
* `RDS_DB_NAME` - database name
* `RDS_USERNAME` - database username
* `RDS_PASSWORD` - database password

TIP: Please note that these variables should be specified for the case when you create a database using EBS. If you created the database separately using RDS or another AWS service, you may not need these variables

In addition to the datasource coordinates, we may want to specify the following properties before the deployment:

* `server.port` - should be set to 5000 by default. You can specify EBS environment property `SERVER_PORT` instead if you like. We will show how to set EBS environment later.
* `jmix.liquibase.enabled` - if set to `true` (default value) - enables automatic execution of Liquibase database migration scripts on application start.

WARNING: Please be careful with the automatic DB update execution on production environments. You may want to disable it and run updates manually.

So, the `application-aws.properties` file content may look like this:

[source,properties,indent=0]
main.datasource.url = jdbc:postgresql://${RDS_HOSTNAME}:${RDS_PORT}/${RDS_DB_NAME}
main.datasource.username = ${RDS_USERNAME}
main.datasource.password = ${RDS_PASSWORD}
server.port=5000

The application is ready, you can create a fat jar and move to the next step.

=== Creating The AWS environment

Log in to the AWS Console and select *Elastic Beanstalk* service from the list of services.

After that, create the application by clicking on a corresponding link on the EBS main page. Enter application information:

* Application name - any name you prefer
* Platform - Java. Select platform branch according to your preferences. Default settings should do.

In the *Application code* section select *Upload your code* option. In the *Source code origin* section for the *Local file* option click on *Choose file* button and upload your application's fat jar. It is usually located in `/build/libs` folder.

Add a database to the environment by clicking on *Configure more options* button. In the configuration page, edit the database parameters

Set database parameters similar to those on the picture

TIP: Setting *Retention* to `Delete` is recommended for test environments. For production environments set it to `Create snapshot` to avoid data loss in case of the application is deleted accidentally.

After creating the database, we have one more step specifying runtime profile to enable proper application configuration - `aws`. In order to do this, edit *Software* settings in the environment configuration page.

In the *Environment properties* section add one more property: `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` and set its value to `aws`.

Save all settings and create the application. The creation and startup usually takes 5-10 minutes.

=== Testing The Deploy

When the application is created and deployed, open the environments list and click on the corresponding environment

In the environment page, click on the *Go to environment* link to open the deployed application page.

The application page should open.
