== Jmix Application Deploy Configuration

The typical Jmix deplyment configuration contains of the following components:

* The application itself
* A relational database
* Reverse Proxy (optional)

The application can be deployed and run as

* Fat Jar
* Docker Image

In fact, the docker image contains the same fat jar inside. You may prefer using image over deploying pure fat jar if you have an experience with containerization, and your infrastructure supports image deploy by providing right services for it.
