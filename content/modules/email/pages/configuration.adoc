[[spring-boot-mail-properties]]
== Spring Boot Mail Properties

Use Spring Boot https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/appendix-application-properties.html#common-application-properties-mail[mail properties^] to define basic email sending parameters, such as protocol, host, port, and others.

For example:

[source, properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=spring-boot-properties]
----

Also, you can specify JavaMail properties in the format `spring.mail.properties.*`. For example, the `mail.smtp.auth` property can be provided as follows:

[source, properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=java-mail-properties]
----

[[email-properties]]
== Jmix Email Properties

Jmix email properties allow you to configure the functionality described in the xref:api.adoc[] section.

[[jmix.email.fromAddress]]
=== jmix.email.fromAddress

Defines the default sender's address. It is used if the `EmailInfo.from` attribute is not specified.

Default value: `DoNotReply@localhost`

[[jmix.email.scheduledSendingDelayCallCount]]
=== jmix.email.scheduledSendingDelayCallCount

Property is used in asynchronous sending of emails to skip the first few calls of `Emailer.processQueuedEmails()` after server startup to reduce the load during application initialization. Email sending will start with the next call.

Default value: `2`

[[jmix.email.messageQueueCapacity]]
=== jmix.email.messageQueueCapacity

Property is used for asynchronous sending, the maximum number of messages read from the queue and sent in one call of `Emailer.processQueuedEmails()`.

Default value: `100`

[[jmix.email.defaultSendingAttemptsCount]]
=== jmix.email.defaultSendingAttemptsCount

Property is used for asynchronous sending, the default number of attempts to send an email. It is used if the `attemptsCount` parameter is not specified when calling `Emailer.sendEmailAsync()`.

Default value: `10`

[[jmix.email.sendingTimeoutSec]]
=== jmix.email.sendingTimeoutSec

Defines the maximum expected time in seconds, which is required to send an email to the SMTP server. It is used for asynchronous sending to optimize the selection of `SendingMessage` objects from the DB queue.

Default value: `240`

[[jmix.email.adminAddress]]
=== jmix.email.adminAddress

Defines the address, to which all messages are sent if the `jmix.email.sendAllToAdmin` property is switched on.

Default value: `admin@localhost`

[[jmix.email.sendAllToAdmin]]
=== jmix.email.sendAllToAdmin

Indicates that all messages should be sent to the `jmix.email.adminAddress` address, regardless of the specified recipientâ€™s address. It is recommended to use this parameter during system development and debugging.

Default value: `false`

[[jmix.email.useFileStorage]]
=== jmix.email.useFileStorage

When turned on, email body text and attachments will be stored in file storage instead of BLOB columns in the database. Should be used if the application stores lots of emails and/or email attachments.

Default value: `false`

[[jmix.emailerUserLogin]]
=== jmix.emailerUserLogin

Defines the login of the system user, used by asynchronous email sending code to be able to persist the information to the database. It is recommended to create a separate user (for example, emailer) without a password so that it will be impossible to log in under their name via user interface. This is also convenient to search for messages related to email sending in the server log.

Default value: `admin`

[[quartz]]
== Configuring Quartz Scheduler

When you call the `Emailer.sendEmailAsync()` method, an email is not sent but queued in the database. To send queued emails, you need to invoke the `Emailer.processQueuedEmails()` method.

Follow the steps below to use https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/[Quartz Job Scheduler^] for periodic processing of the email queue.

. Add the following line to the `dependencies` section of your `build.gradle` file:
+
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/build.gradle[tags=quartz-dependency]
----

. Add the following properties to the `application.properties` file:
+
[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=quartz]
----
+
If you use PostgreSQL and get the exception "org.quartz.JobPersistenceException: Couldn't retrieve job: Bad value for type long" on application start, set the following property:
+
[source,properties]
----
spring.quartz.properties.org.quartz.jobStore.driverDelegateClass=org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.PostgreSQLDelegate
----

. Create a job class:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/email/ex1/EmailSendingJob.java[tags=quartz]
----

. Add the following beans to the main application class:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/email/ex1/SampleEmailApplication.java[tags=quartz]
----
+
<1> This http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html[Cron expression^] means "every minute".

As a result, all queued emails will be sent once a minute.

[[file-storage-usage]]
== File Storage Usage

You can store email body text and attachments in file storage instead of BLOB columns in the database.

To use file storage:

. Add the following line to the `dependencies` section of your `build.gradle` file:
+
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/build.gradle[tags=fs-dependency]
----
+
. Enable file storage usage. Set in `application.properties` file:
+
[source, properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=fs-enable]
----

By default, the local file storage is located in the application work directory at `${user.dir}/.jmix/work/filestorage`.
