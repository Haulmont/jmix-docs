= Localization

The goal of internationalization and localization of an application is to adapt it to different languages and data formats.

Internationalization is the process of preparing the application to be localized, and localization is the process of providing content and formats for a particular locale. In this sense, any Jmix application is inherently internationalized, because Jmix framework itself contains all means for presenting the application in different languages and data formats. All you have to do as the application developer is to provide required translations, that is to localize the application.
