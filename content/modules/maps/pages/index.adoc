= Maps

The add-on helps you to enrich your application with visual representation and intuitive manipulation for spatial data. You can use a preferable map provider that meets your needs.

The component integrates spatial types (point, polyline, polygon) from https://locationtech.github.io/jts/[JTS Topology Suite] (JTS) — the most popular Java library for working with spatial data. 

//The add-on provides all the required features to build a comprehensive geographical information system on Jmix.

The add-on supports a traditional multi-layer structure commonly used in professional GIS systems. The layers are represented as structural units of maps.

You can use the following types of layers:

* xref:raster-layers.adoc#raster-layers[Raster layers] that consist of raster images. Can be provided by xref:glossary.adoc#xyz-tiles[XYZ tiles services] or xref:glossary.adoc#web-map-service[Web Map Services].
* xref:vector-layers.adoc#vector-layers[Vector layers] that contain geo-objects — entities with geometry attributes.

The add-on supports drawing and interactive editing of geo-entities and provides features for geoanalysis: heatmaps and clustering.
