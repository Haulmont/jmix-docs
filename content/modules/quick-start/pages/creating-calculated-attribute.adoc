== Creating Calculated Attribute

Now, we need to create an auto-calculated attribute for the talk’s end date and time. Create a new attribute `endDate` of `LocalDateTime` type and mark it as *Transient*. We do not need to generate a field for this attribute, so clear the *Create field* checkbox.

For the calculated attribute, we need to specify the fields to be loaded. In our case, these are `startDate` and `duration`. Click on the *✎* icon in the *Related attributes* field to invoke the editor.

After creating the attribute, switch to the editor and add the calculation logic.

That’s it. Our domain model has been created with calculated fields.
