== Creating Calculated Attribute

Now, we need to create an auto calculated attribute for the talk’s end date and time. Create a new attribute `endDate` of `LocalDateTime` type and mark it as *Transient*. We do not need to generate a field for this attribute, so uncheck the *Create field* checkbox.

For the calculated attribute, we need to specify the fields to be loaded. In our case, these are `startDate` and `duration`. Click on the *✎* icon in the *Related attributes* field to invoke the editor.

After creating the attribute, switch to the editor and add the calculation logic.

In the previous section - "link:creating-data-model.adoc[Creating application's data model]", for the `Speaker` entity we have defined `lastName` as an entity's instance display name. Now we can define a method that will use a speaker's full name to display them in the UI.

To do this, we need to create a new method - `getFullName()` in the `Speaker` class and make its return type `String`. Then we need to move (cut and paste) annotation `@InstanceName` from `lastName` field to this method and add `@DependsOnProperties` annotation to use `firstName` and `lastName` fields in the method. Then all we need to do is to generate full speaker's name in the method body.

That’s it. Our domain model has been created with calculated fields.
