== Database Creation

For this example, we will use an in-memory database - HSQLDB, so the database itself will be created automatically. If you want to use a different RDBMS like MySQL or PostgreSQL, please create an empty database according to your RDBMS documentation.

You can find database settings in the *Data Stores* section of the xref:studio:tool-window.adoc[Jmix tool window].

You can double-click *Main Data Store* to open database settings.

If you would prefer using a different RDBMS for this quick start, make sure that URL, username and password match the connection parameters for the database that you had created manually.

Jmix uses Liquibase for database creation and updates, so we need to generate Liquibase scripts to create the database for the conference planner. Jmix Studio analyzes the existing database schema and generates scripts to synchronize the existing JPA data model and database tables.

To start Liquibase scripts generation, right-click  *Main Data Store* in Jmix tool window and select *Generate Liquibase Changelog*. Please note that you may see a message that some scripts have not been applied. This happens due to a system `User` entity that was created automatically. Please apply scripts before generating scripts for new entities.

You can review the generated scripts in the project sources in `src/main/resources/<project_package>/liquibase` folder.

You can add custom scripts if you want to add some specific things like additional indexes or insert statements for the initial data. Please refer to the xref:data-model:db-migration.adoc[] section for more information.

After scripts are created, you can apply them to the database. Right-click *Main Data Store* in the Jmix tool window and select *Update*.
