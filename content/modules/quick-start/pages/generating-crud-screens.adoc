== Generating CRUD Screens
Jmix Studio contains a UI screen generation wizard that helps us to create basic, but useful UI screens:

* Browser - to show the list of entities in a grid.
* Editor - to edit one entity instance using a form-like user interface.

=== Screens for Speaker Entity

First, we will create screens to work with speakers. Start a wizard by selecting *Create screen* in the *Screens* menu on the top of the entity designer.

Also, you can use Jmix tool window to start screen generation wizard. Open the context menu by clicking the `+` icon in the toolbar and select *Screen*.

For the `Speaker` entity, we will create a default browser and editor. Select *Entity browser and editor screens* in the wizard and click *Next*. Since this entity is pretty simple, we can accept the default parameters for the screen creation.

Click *Next* on all other screen creation steps and two screens will be created.

Each screen consists of two parts: a controller, written in Java, which is responsible for internal screen logic and events handling, and an XML layout that defines the screen appearance. In our case, the browser consists of the `SpeakerBrowse.java` and `speaker-browse.xml` files and editor - `SpeakerEdit.java` and `speaker-edit.xml` accordingly.

You can find XML descriptors in the *Data Model* sections in the Jmix tool window.

To open the controller, use the context menu.

Please pay attention to the `data` section in the XML screen descriptors - it defines how the data is fetched from the database.

You can easily navigate between a screen controller, descriptor, and linked entities with Jmix Studio using buttons on the top of the window:

[[qs-generating-screens-for-talk]]
=== Screens for Talk Entity

Run the screen generation wizard for the `Talk` entity, select *Entity browser and editor screens* and stop at the *Entity browser fetch plan* step.

In Jmix we can define several fetch plans for every entity. They specify which fields will be fetched from the database. You can define fetch plans in a separate file to use them in the different modules of your application, or create an inline fetch plan while creating a screen.

Letâ€™s create an inline fetch plan. In addition to selected properties, mark end date and speaker reference.

At the next step, the necessary fields are already selected.

After screens are created, you can see screen preview by using buttons in the top right corner of the screen layout editor.

. Markup-only view.
. Combined markup and preview.
. Preview only.
. Preview in a popup window.

The preview shows that all selected attributes are added to the screens.
