== Generating CRUD Screens
Jmix Studio contains a UI screen generation wizard that helps us to create basic, but useful UI screens:

* Browser - to show the list of entities in a grid
* Editor - to edit one entity instance using a form-like user interface

=== Screens for "Speaker" Entity
First, we will create screens to work with speakers. Since this entity is pretty simple, we will use the default parameters for the screen creation. Start a wizard by clicking on *Create Screen* menu item in *Screens* menu on the top of the entity designer.

You can also start screen generation wizard by right-clicking on an entity in Jmix Project tree and selecting New -> Screen from the context menu.

For the `Speaker` entity, we will create default browser and editor. Select *Entity browser and editor screens* on the *Screen Templates* tab in the wizard and click *Next*. Since this entity is pretty simple, we can accept the default parameters for the screen creation.

Just click *Next* on all other screen creation steps and two screens will be created.

Each screen consists of two parts: a controller, written in java, which is responsible for internal screen logic and events handling, and an XML layout that defines the screen appearance. In our case, the browser will consist of files `SpeakerBrowse.java` and `speaker-browse.xml` and editor - `SpeakerEdit.java` and `speaker-edit.xml` accordingly.

You can find sources for these screens in `main/java` and `main/resources` sections in the project's source tree.

Please note the `data` section in the XML screen descriptors - it defines how the data is fetched from the database.

[source,xml]
----
<data readOnly="true">
    <collection id="speakersDc"
                class="com.company.planner.entity.Speaker">
        <fetchPlan extends="_local"/>
        <loader id="speakersDl">
            <query>
                <![CDATA[select e from plnnr_Speaker e]]>
            </query>
        </loader>
    </collection>
</data>

You can easily navigate between screen controller, descriptor and linked entities with Jmix Studio using buttons on the top of the window:

[[qs-generating-screens-for-talk]]
=== Screens for "Talk" Entity

Run the screen generation wizard for the `Talk` entity, select *Entity browser and editor screens* and stop at the *Entity browser fetch plan* step.

In Jmix for every entity we can define several fetch plans. They specify which fields will be fetched from the database. You can define fetch plans in a separate file to use them in the different modules of your application, or create inline fetch plan while creating a screen.

Letâ€™s create an inline fetch plan. In addition to selected properties, mark end date and speaker reference.

You can see that all selected attributes are added to the screens.

To see screen preview, you can use buttons in the top right corner of the screen layout editor:
