== Preface
In this quick start, we will scratch the surface of Jmix and develop a very simple, but fully functional planner application that will help with talk scheduling for a conference. It will show some necessary things for creating any web application: how to design a data model, how to manipulate data, how to create business logic, and, finally, how to create a user interface. In fact, this tutorial will be just enough for you to start your own Jmix application, so let's get started. In this tutorial, we will use Jmix Studio, so please xref:ROOT:setup.adoc[install it before you begin].
