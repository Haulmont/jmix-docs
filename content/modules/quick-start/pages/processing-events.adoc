== Processing Events
Jmix provides an API to handle various events happening in the application - starting from entities persistence process to mouse clicks on a buttons.

With Jmix Studio, you can generate empty event handlers and then add your business logic into the generated code. For the conference planning application, we need to set default value for the talk duration when creating talk in the UI

=== Handling Screen Events

Jmix's Generic UI allows developers to handle various events that are generated by screens and components. All you need to do is to create a method with a proper signature and annotation for a particular event. Jmix Studio provides a GUI that allows you to initiate handler's code generation from the component inspector.

To generate default value for the talk duration property we need to handle talk creation event in the editor screen. To do that, you need to open the `talk-edit.xml` file and select `window` component in the *Component Hierarchy* tool window in the top right corner in the Jmix Studio.

After that, you should be able to see all possible handlers in th *Component Inspector* window in the left bottom corner of the IDE. The tool window may be collapsed, just expand it by pressing the corresponding button on the left IDE window border.

We need to process `InitEntityEvent` event, just double-click on the corresponding `<empty>` section in the *Component Inspector*. You will be redirected to the screen controller, where you should be able to fill the handler body with a simple assignment. Just get a newly created entity from the event object and set duration to one hour.
