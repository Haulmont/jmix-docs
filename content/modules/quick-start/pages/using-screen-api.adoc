== Using Screen API

Let’s handle a click on a calendar’s entry and invoke the talk editor. For screen manipulations, Jmix provides a screen builder API that we will use.

In the `talk-browse.xml` select `talksCalendar` and go to the *Handlers* tab in the Component Inspector window. Select *CalendarEventClickEvent* handler and click on the ▶ icon to generate the code and move to the controller.

The empty method will be generated for you.

[source,java]
----
@Subscribe("talksCalendar")
public void onTalksCalendarCalendarEventClick(Calendar.CalendarEventClickEvent<LocalDateTime> event) {

}

We need to invoke the editor screen to change the talk’s properties. Jmix framework provides a set of screen API services to simplify work with the Generic UI screens.

To get access to screen API, specifically to the `ScreenBuilders` service, you need to inject it into the screen.

To do this, click on the *Inject* button in the screen's controller source code editor toolbar:

And in the dialog window, select the service:

Jmix's screen builder API allows us to do invoke the editor pretty easy by adding several method calls to a builder step by step:

* Create an editor for the `Talk` entity using `this` instance of the browser screen as a parent
* Then we specify the entity instance that will be edited by extracting it from the UI event
* After that - define editor's open mode. It will be dialog for our case
* Then we specify exact editor's screen class. In general, there might be more that one screen that can be used to edit the talk
* Then we need to reload data in the screen if the editor was closed using the *Save* button
* Finally, we show the editor

The code below just illustrates all the steps.

Now if you restart the application and click on an event, you will see the talk editor.

The editor doesn’t look nice, so we need to adjust its width and height. In the IDE, open the screen’s XML descriptor - `talk-edit.xml`, select *dialogMode* component in the *Component Hierarchy* window and set width and height properties to `auto` in the *Component Inspector*.

Restart the application, open the *Talk browser* and click on a talk on the calendar again - you should see the editor dialog displayed correctly.

Now the editor looks nicer.
