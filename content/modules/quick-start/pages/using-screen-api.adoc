== Using Screen API

Let’s handle a click on a calendar’s entry and invoke the talk editor. For screen manipulations, Jmix provides a screen builder API that we will use.

In the `talk-browse.xml` file, select `talksCalendar` and go to the *Handlers* tab in the *Component Inspector* window. Select *CalendarEventClickEvent* handler and click on the ▶ icon to generate the code, and then move to the controller.

The empty method will be generated for you.

We need to invoke the editor screen to change the talk’s properties. Jmix framework provides screen API to simplify work with the Backoffice UI screens.

To get access to screen API, specifically to the `ScreenBuilders` bean, you need to inject it into the screen.

To do this, click on the *Inject* button in the screen's controller source code editor toolbar:

To search for the bean, start typing its name and then use *Up* and *Down* keys to navigate between objects available for injection.

Jmix's screen builder API allows us to do invoke the editor pretty easily by adding several method calls to a builder step by step. The code below illustrates all the steps:

<1> Creates an editor for the `Talk` entity using `this` instance of the browser screen as a parent.
<2> Specifies the entity instance that will be edited by extracting it from the UI event.
<3> Defines editor's open mode. It will be a dialog for our case.
<4> Specifies the exact editor's screen class. In general, there might be more than one screen that can be used to edit the talk.
<5> Reloads data in the screen if the editor was closed using the *Save* button.
<6> Shows the editor.

Now, if you restart the application and click on an event, you will see the talk editor.

The editor doesn’t look nice, so we need to adjust its width and height. In the IDE, open the screen’s XML descriptor - `talk-edit.xml`, select *dialogMode* component in the *Component Hierarchy* window and set `width` and `height` properties to `auto` in the *Component Inspector*.

Restart the application, open the *Talk browser* and click on the talk in the calendar again - the size of the dialog is exactly adjusted to its content.
