== Delete Entities

The Entities API finally allows you to delete entities that should be removed from the application. The corresponding endpoint is once again: `/entities/:entityName/:entityId` using the HTTP method `DELETE`.

The following example removes a previously created Customer.


[source, http request]
.Request
----
DELETE http://localhost:8080/rest
            /entities
            /rstex11_Customer
            /13f01f59-8e5f-4fd9-802b-66501d49ac99
----

In case the entity exists, the response status `200 - OK` is returned without any response body and the entity is deleted from the application. In case the entity is not found, `404 - Not Found` is returned.

TIP: The Entities API takes xref:data-model:soft-deletion.adoc.adoc[Soft Deletion] into consideration. Depending on the setting of the entity, the instance is therefore either only soft-deleted or deleted entirely from the application.
