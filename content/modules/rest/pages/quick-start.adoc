= Quick Start

This section contains a practical guide on getting started with the generic REST API.

Letâ€™s consider that we want to retrieve information about orders in the application through the REST API.

First, add generic REST to your project according to the xref:index.adoc#installation[installation] section.

== Create REST enabled Role


The first thing is to configure security according to <<security,Security>> section:

* Create a role that includes `rest.enabled` specific permission and grants permissions to read the user entity
* Assign the created role to the user that you want to use (like `admin`)

Start the application and test the REST API using the `curl` command-line tool.

== Authenticate as a User

As the first request, you need to perform a login or `Authentication request`. This happens through the following command:


----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/rest/oauth/token \
   --basic --user client:secret \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
   -d 'grant_type=password&username=admin&password=admin'
----

The response that you receive back contains a JSON document with information about the result of the authentication request:

----
HTTP/1.1 200

{
  "access_token": "CXE0w/9cOsnpSo8v2jEDoI8Qa3Y=",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "refresh_token": "Hh2xCuZ7fgd35obagEBNGevF4ws=",
  "expires_in": 31535999,
  "scope": "rest-api",
  "OAuth2.SESSION_ID": "5C46CDF266E8C8C15372887830B74F59"
}
----
The attribute `access_token` contains the token that you can use for further request as part of the `Authorization` Header.


== Retrieve Entity List

Request the list of users (replace `<access_token>` with the value obtained on the previous step):

----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/rest/entities/sample_User \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"
----

The response will contain all users that are available in the application.
