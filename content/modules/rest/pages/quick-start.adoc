= Quick Start

This section contains a practical guide on getting started with the generic REST API.

Letâ€™s consider that we want to retrieve information about orders in the application through the REST API.

First, add generic REST to your project according to the xref:index.adoc#installation[installation] section.

== Create REST enabled Role


The first thing is to configure security according to xref:rest:security.adoc[Security] section:

* Create a role that includes `rest.enabled` specific permission and grants permissions to read the user entity.
* Assign the created role to the user that you want to use (like `admin`).

Start the application and test the REST API using the `curl` command-line tool.

== Authenticate as a User

As the first request, you need to perform a login or `Authentication request`. Use the following `cURL` command to do the request:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth/token \
   --basic --user client:secret \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
   -d 'grant_type=password&username=admin&password=admin'
----

The response that you receive back contains a JSON document with information about the result of the authentication request:

.HTTP/1.1 200
[source, json]
----
{
  "access_token": "CXE0w/9cOsnpSo8v2jEDoI8Qa3Y=",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "refresh_token": "Hh2xCuZ7fgd35obagEBNGevF4ws=",
  "expires_in": 31535999,
  "scope": "rest-api",
  "OAuth2.SESSION_ID": "5C46CDF266E8C8C15372887830B74F59"
}
----
The attribute `access_token` contains the token that you can use for further requests as part of the `Authorization` Header.


== Retrieve Entity List
Now that you performed a successful login on the API, the generic REST API endpoints can be used to load a list of users (replace `<access_token>` with the value obtained on the previous step):

[source, bash]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/rest/entities/sample_User \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"
----

The response will contain all users that are available in the application:

.HTTP/1.1 200
[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "_entityName": "sample_User",
    "_instanceName": "  [admin]",
    "id": "60885987-1b61-4247-94c7-dff348347f93",
    "password": "{noop}admin",
    "version": 1,
    "enabled": true,
    "username": "admin"
  }
]
