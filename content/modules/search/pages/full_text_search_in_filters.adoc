= Full-text Search in Filters

== FullTextFilter UI Component

A new component may be added to the screen:

[source,xml]
----
<window xmlns="http://jmix.io/schema/ui/window"
        xmlns:search="http://jmix.io/schema/search/ui">
	<search:fullTextFilter dataLoader="customersDl" searchStrategy="allTermsSingleField"/>
</window>
----

Attributes:

* `dataLoader` - a DataLoader related to the current component
* `searchStrategy` (optional) - a search strategy used for searching. If the strategy is not defined, then a default strategy is used
* `autoApply` (optional) - true if the filter component should be automatically applied to the DataLoader when the value component value is changed

The component works like the `<propertyFilter>` or `<jpqlFilter>` components. The values in the table or in the databaGrid associated with the dataLoader will be refreshed. Only records that match the full-text search criteria will be displayed.

== Full-text search condition in the generic filter component

After the search add-on is added to the project, a new condition appears in the "Add condition" window of the generic filter component:

The full-text filter condition editor allows you to specify a caption for the full-text filter and to select a search strategy (optional). If no search strategy is selected, then a default one is used.

Records in the list component associated with the generic filter will be filtered based on the full-text search result.
