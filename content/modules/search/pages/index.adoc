= Search

This add-on allows you to enable full-text search capabilities in your application with https://www.elastic.co[Elasticsearch^].

The guide shows how to start using search in your application. Jmix uses Elasticsearch as a base for its search engine. In Jmix, if we need to search data (basically, entities), we need to build indexes for them. More information about search internals and indexing, can be found in https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/documents-indices.html[Elasticsearch documentation^].
