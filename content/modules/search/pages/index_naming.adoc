= Index Naming

Search indexes have the following naming template:

[source,xml]
----
<prefix><entity_name>
----

Default prefix is `search_index_`.

If multiple projects use the same ES service you must ensure that index names are unique: all projects must have unique entity names or (if there are coinciding entity names) projects must have different prefixes.

Prefixes can be configured by adding the following property to your `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
jmix.search.searchIndexNamePrefix=my_custom_prefix_
----
