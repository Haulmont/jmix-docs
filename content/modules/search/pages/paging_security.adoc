= Paging & Security

Seach security is divided into two parts - pre-search and post-search.

Pre-search security checks entity-level policies and exclude indexes related to forbidden entities.

Post-search security checks if there are any row-level security policies configured to found instances. If they exist found instances will be reloaded to apply security policies.

`EntitySearcher` tries to fill the entire page with data within its search request execution. If some data will be excluded from the current result set due to security restrictions and there are more suitable documents in indexes, `EntitySearcher` automatically performs additional search requests with shifted offset to fetch more data.

This is going to happen over and over until the page is full or data runs out.
