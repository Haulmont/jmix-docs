= Using Search API

Here is an example of the programmatic usage of the Search API. Assume that the API is called from the backoffice UI when you click on a button. The query will look for an entity of an Order type through fields marked for indexing that contain an `"apple"` string. To use the API, you need to inject the EntitySearcher service. The `SearchResultProcessor` can be used to fetch data from the search result.

    @Subscribe("searchBtn")
    public void onSearchBtnClick(Button.ClickEvent event) {
        SearchContext ctx = new SearchContext("apple").setSize(10).setEntities("Order");
        SearchResult searchResult = entitySearcher.search(ctx);
        Collection<Object> instances = searchResultProcessor.loadEntityInstances(searchResult);
        //Cast and show collection in the grid, etc.
    }
