= Working with Project

This section describes how to create a new project, open an existing one, and start the application.

== Creating New Project

Studio provides a wizard to create new Jmix projects from scratch. 

. Open *New Project* wizard from the main menu: *File -> New -> Project*. Also, you can click *New Project* in the welcome screen of IDE.
. Select *Jmix Project* in the dialog.
+

+
Configure the main project settings on this step:

* You can accept the default repository that is specified in the *Repository* field, or select *Custom repository* and customize it for the project.
* Select *Use local Maven repository* if you want to use artifacts from the local repository.
* Select the *Jmix version* to be used in the project. If you do not have any specific requirements, use the latest released version.
+
For beta-testing or early accessing new Jmix framework features, you might want to use one of unstable Jmix framework versions, ones that end with BETA or SNAPSHOT suffixes. To see them in the *Jmix version* drop-down list, you need to select the *Show unstable versions* checkbox.
+
* In the *Project JDK* field, select JDK corresponding to `JAVA_HOME` which is set in your environment. If you see the `<No JDK>` value, click *Add JDK* in the list and select the folder, where JDK is installed, for example, `C:\Java\jdk8u202-b08` on Windows or `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk8u202-b08/Contents/Home` on macOS.
+
. On the next wizard step, select a template to be used for creating an empty project.
+

+
. In the next window, you can set the project's name, location, and localization.
+

+
* Change value of the *Project name* field, if required. The name should contain only Latin letters, numbers, and underscores.
* *Project location* is the path to the new project directory. You can select another directory by typing it in the field or clicking the  button next to the field.
* Change *Base package* if necessary. It is the or base package for Java classes. It can be adjusted later, but the classes generated at project creation will not be moved.
* *Project id* is optional. If it is set, module names of the Jmix project are prepended with this prefix. The length must not be longer than 7 characters.
* Use the *Locales* field to open an editor and add more supported locales to the project. You will be able to change them later if required.
. Click *Finish*. The empty project will be created in the specified directory, and Studio will start building the project information from Gradle files and indexing the project.
+
When the project synchronization and indexing process is completed, you will see the Jmix project tree in the Jmix Tool Window.

Now you can start working on the project.

[[opening-existing-project]]
== Opening Existing Project

=== Opening Imported Project

If the project has already been opened by Jmix Studio on your computer, you can open it using one of the ways:

* Select the required project from the recent project. You can do it in the welcome window of the IDE or open *File -> Open Recent* from the main menu.
* Open *File -> Open...* from the main menu and select the project’s folder in the file system dialog, then click *OK*.

Wait for Gradle synchronization and project indexing process to complete. As soon as the project tree appears in the xref:studio:tool-window.adoc[Jmix Tool Window], you can start working with the project.

=== Opening Project for the First Time

If the project has not been opened by Jmix Studio on your computer yet, for example, just checked out from VCS, do the following:

. Click *Open* in the welcome window of the IDE. 
+

+
If another project is already opened, go *File -> New -> Project* from the main window.
. In the file system dialog, select the project’s root folder containing the `build.gradle` file and click *OK*.
+
image::new-project-5.png[aligen="center"]
+
. In the appeared dialog, select *Open as Project*.
+
Wait for Gradle synchronization and project indexing process to complete. The Jmix project tree should appear in the Jmix Tool Window.
+
. Open *File -> Project Structure...* from the main menu.
+

* Make sure that the *Project SDK* field has a value corresponding to `JAVA_HOME` which is set in your environment. If you see the `<No SDK>` value, select *Add SDK* from the list and select the folder where the JDK is installed, for example, `C:\Java\jdk8u202-b08` on Windows or `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk8u202-b08/Contents/Home` on macOS.
* Make sure that the *Project language level* field has a value corresponding to the JDK version. For example, if the JDK is `1.8`, the language level must be `8 - Lambdas, type annotations, etc`.

== Upgrading Project

Coming soon.

== Starting Application

When Studio imports Jmix project, it creates Run/Debug Configuration. You can use buttons in the main toolbar to run and stop your application.

To run the application and connect to it with a debugger, just click the debug button next to the selected *Jmix Application* configuration.

See the status in the *Console* tab of the *Debug* tool window.

image::run-2.png[align="center"]

After some time you can access the application using the browser. By default, the URL will be `\http://localhost:8080/` .

You can stop the application server in the main toolbar or by clicking the button in the *Debug* tool window.

=== Run/Debug Configuration Settings

You can adjust settings of the embedded Tomcat server which is used by the Jmix Application Run/Debug configuration. 

You can open the settings dialog by clicking the Jmix Application element in the toolbar and choose *Edit Configurations…*​ in the context menu.

Also, you can open it from the main menu: *Run → Edit Configurations…​*.

The Run/Debug Configuration dialog appears.

You might be interested in editing the following settings:

* *Arguments* – JVM options to be passed to the debug server. For example, specify `-Xmx1500m` to increase maximum allowed memory usage for the server.
* *Environment variables* – environment variables that should be available to the debug server process.

== Using Non-Default JDK

Both IntelliJ IDEA and Gradle by default use Java Development Kit (JDK) defined by the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to assemble and run Java projects. In order to use the non-default JDK in your project without touching global system settings, you need to perform several steps.

Let’s consider that `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the JDK 8 and you want to use JDK 11 in your project.

You need to perform the following steps:

. Open *File → Project Structure...* from the main menu. 
. Select SDKs in the left menu. Press + button and select *Add JDK*.
+
image::jdk-1.png[align="center"]
+
. Select JDK 11 installation folder. Press *OK* to save changes.
. If you create a new Jmix project, "11" for the Project SDK field.
+
For existing projects open *File → Project Structure...* from the main menu and change the *Project -> Project SDK* value.
. Navigate to the project root folder and create `gradle.properties` file with the following text:
+
[source,properties]
----
# Path to JDK 11
org.gradle.java.home = C:/Java/jdk-11.0.5.10-hotspot
----
+
. Modify the `build.gradle` file located in the project root folder. Add the following statements:
+
[source,gradle]
----
group = '...'
version = '...'
sourceCompatibility = '11'
targetCompatibility = '11'
----
+
. In the Gradle tool window click *Reload All Gradle Projects* to refresh the Gradle project configuration.

When these changes are performed, the project is going to be compiled and run with JDK 11, without changing global system settings.
