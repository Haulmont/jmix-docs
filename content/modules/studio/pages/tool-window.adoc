* In the *Repository* field, you can choose one of the available repositories. If you want to use several repositories, select *Custom repository* and add them. In the table, you can choose repositories currently used in the project. Studio scans these repositories to discover what platform versions are available. You can also manually register any number of additional repositories containing application components in the `build.gradle` script.
* The *Jmix version* field displays version of the framework used in the project. The *Change…*​ link located nearby allows you to upgrade the framework version, an automatic migration will be performed if required.
* In the *Locales* tab, you can set locales used in your application. The editor also enables defining or overriding format strings for xref:data-model:data-types.adoc#localized-format-strings[parsing and formatting data].
